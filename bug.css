The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as intended on the nested elements. The `div` with id `outer` has a background color that should change when hovered over, and the nested `div` with id `inner` should not inherit the hover effect. However, in some browsers or CSS implementations, hovering over the inner div unexpectedly triggers the hover effect on the outer div, leading to unexpected behavior.

```css
div#outer {
  background-color: lightgray;
}
div#outer:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
div#inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: white;
}
```

```html
<div id="outer">
  <div id="inner"></div>
</div>
```
